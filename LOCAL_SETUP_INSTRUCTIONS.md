# 🏠 Local Setup Instructions

## Quick Fix for Your Current Issue

You're getting the "data/ - Missing" error because the data directory wasn't created yet. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Create Data Directories
```bash
python setup_data_dirs.py
```

### 2. Test Installation Again
```bash
python test_installation.py
```

You should now see:
```
🎉 Installation test PASSED!
🚀 Ready to run: python run_app.py
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python run_app.py
```

## What the setup_data_dirs.py Script Does

- Creates `data/` directory structure
- Sets up subdirectories for:
  - `user_profiles/` - User profile data
  - `local_data/` - Climate data cache
  - `climate_vectordb/` - Vector database storage
- Adds `.gitkeep` files to track empty directories
- Creates a demo user profile for testing

## Your Environment is Already Configured

✅ You have all the API keys in your .env file  
✅ All dependencies are installed  
✅ Python version is compatible  

The only missing piece was the data directory structure, which is now fixed!

## Next Steps

1. Run `python setup_data_dirs.py` 
2. Run `python test_installation.py` to verify
3. Run `python run_app.py` to start the application
4. Open your browser to the displayed URL (usually http://localhost:8501)
