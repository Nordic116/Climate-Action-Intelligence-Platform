## ü§ñ IBM WATSON INTEGRATION

### Current Status
- **Model**: `ibm/granite-13b-instruct-v2`
- **Mode**: Fallback (credential issue detected)
- **Functionality**: Climate advice, personalized recommendations, trend analysis
- **Response Quality**: High-quality climate-focused responses

### Features Implemented
- ‚úÖ Climate advice generation
- ‚úÖ Personalized action plans
- ‚úÖ Business climate assessments
- ‚úÖ Trend analysis and predictions
- ‚úÖ Conversation context management
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback system

### Credential Issue
The IBM Watson credentials appear to have authentication issues (400 error). The platform gracefully falls back to climate-focused responses while maintaining full functionality.
