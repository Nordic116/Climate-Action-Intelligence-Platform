- Seal air leaks around windows/doors
- Use power strips to eliminate phantom loads

**PHASE 2: Transportation (3-12 months) - 12% reduction**
- Combine trips and use efficient routes
- Work from home 2+ days/week if possible
- Consider carpooling or public transit
- Maintain vehicle properly (tire pressure, tune-ups)

**PHASE 3: Major Upgrades (6-18 months) - 10%+ reduction**
- Install programmable/smart thermostat
- Upgrade to high-efficiency appliances
- Consider solar panels or community solar
- Improve home insulation

📊 **Expected Impact:**
- Energy efficiency: 15-20% reduction
- Transportation changes: 8-15% reduction  
- Renewable energy: 5-10% additional reduction
- **Total potential: 30-45% carbon footprint reduction**
